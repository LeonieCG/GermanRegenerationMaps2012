# German Regeneration Maps 2012
We combined regeneration density observations from the German NFI to map the forest regeneration across Germany and evaluate potential regeneration gaps using a three-step approach.
First, we combined the NFI regeneration data with environmental data to construct species-specific regeneration models.
Second, we evaluated the predictive performance of the regeneration models using 10-fold blocked cross-validation and used the validated models to predict regeneration densities for the forest area of Germany. 
Third, we mapped indicators of regeneration quantity and quality, demonstrating their potential application for Bavaria.<br />
